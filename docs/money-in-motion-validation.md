- 737 high-confidence estimates

- SEC remains 100.0% of supported estimates; the <50% target is not met because non-SEC sources do not yet provide enough transaction-value plus ownership evidence.

## Integrity checks

- Personal estimate without ownership evidence: 0
- Named person inferred from GDELT news: 0
- Duplicate source-event assignment across clusters: 0
- Confidence outside 0–100: 0
- Actionability outside 0–100: 0

## Evidence boundaries

- CMS owner records add named people only when the official all-owners dataset supplies a name. A personal liquidity estimate is not produced without transaction consideration.
- GDELT supplies discovery and timing evidence. A headline never creates a named-person estimate, and syndicated exact-title copies count once for corroboration.
- STB case-status records remain pending-regulatory until completion evidence is available.
- USPTO is LIVE when `USPTO_API_KEY` is configured: the current ODP PASDL daily XML release is bounded, cached, and filtered to exclude name changes, corrective records, and security interests. No cash consideration is inferred.
- FCC, FERC, state registries, commercial property, and broker feeds remain import-only until a documented public or licensed machine-readable feed is configured.
- No residential address is used for lead generation.
