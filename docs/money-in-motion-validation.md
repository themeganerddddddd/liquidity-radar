## Integrity checks

- Personal estimate without ownership evidence: 0
- Named person inferred from GDELT news: 0
- Duplicate source-event assignment across clusters: 0
- Confidence outside 0–100: 0
- Actionability outside 0–100: 0

## Evidence boundaries

- CMS owner records add named people only when the official all-owners dataset supplies a name. A personal liquidity estimate is not produced without transaction consideration.
- GDELT supplies discovery and timing evidence. A headline never creates a named-person estimate, and syndicated exact-title copies count once for corroboration.
- STB case-status records remain pending-regulatory until completion evidence is available.
- USPTO is LIVE when `USPTO_API_KEY` is configured: current ODP PASDL daily ZIP files are processed through bounded disk and XML streams. Name changes, corrections, security interests, liens, licenses, internal reorganizations, and unknown conveyances are excluded. No cash consideration is inferred.
- FCC, FERC, state registries, commercial property, and broker feeds remain import-only until a documented public or licensed machine-readable feed is configured.
- No residential address is used for lead generation.
